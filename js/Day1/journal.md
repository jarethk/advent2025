Part 1 - fairly straight-forward, process the inputs, make negative if turning left, and accumulate at each stage to report when we hit zero.

Part 2 - a bit more complex. I first tried doing some fancy math, but settled into doing some conditional statements with simpler math to find how many times we passed zero in each turn.
