Part 1 - the first part to find the number of paths wasn't too complex, considering it is single-direction and no circular paths. Set up DFS processing, keeping track of just where we are and how many steps we've taken. A simple increment every time we hit the target state.

Part 2 - Quite a bit more complex because the path depth was huge! Fortunately someone had visually mapped out the different state paths and highlighed the particular states we had to pass through. With that information I was able to set up a faster process just going from 'svr' to 'fft', then another going from 'fft' to 'dac', and last from 'dac' to 'out'. Multiply those together to get our number of possible paths. This reminds me of a common tip: inspect the inputs, there are often clues in there that help with efficient solutions.
