Part 1 - I was expecting this to be more complex. The examples show the pieces fitting together based on their shape. I tried as a first pass to just do some math, based on the area available figure out how many 3x3 shapes could fit in there, and use that to quickly include any that were clearly large enough, and focus on the ones that might be a tighter fit. Turns out that was actually the answer, no complicated fitting of shapes.

Part 2 - Always love the part 2 from the last day.
